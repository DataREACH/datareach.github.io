      <h3> Mission Statement </h3>
      <p class="lead">As data science continues to grow as an integral part of life in the 21 st century,
        its applications around the world continue to diversify and change the status quo. Our mission is
        to harness the powerful applications of machine learning and predictive analytics to make a positive
        impact on medicine in developing nations. Through the training of medical professionals on the
        fundamentals of data science as well as assisting in the creation of advanced analytics pipelines
        via machine learning, we hope to make groundbreaking strides in integrating AI in medicine in developing nations.

          <h3>Cameroon 2016</h3> <br>
          <p>In the summer of 2016 Project DataREACH expanded with a project
            in Cameroon thanks to a collaboration with Songhai Labs, which
            is global Knowledge Broker Platform for the African Continent with
            the ambition to positively transform African societies by sharing
            knowledge and innovations across countries and across sectors. We
            are currently working on a proposal to obtain some data from
            medical entities in Cameroon to begin looking into ways in which
            machine learning pipelines can usefully be created. We are also
            planning remote basic training sessions to enable motivated medical
            professionals in Cameroon to apply data science techniques to
            data they have access to and begin discussion of how these
            skills will impact the nation long term.
