          Project DataREACH began in the summer of 2015, with a trip to Guyana,
          presenting at hospitals, universities, medical schools, and government
          entities (Ministry of Health and National Cancer Institute) about the
          potential for the application of data science in medicine, including
          machine learning/predictive analytics for risk assessment, as well as
          exploring techniques to utilize surveillance data. Project DataREACH
          was commended by Guyana's Ministry of Health and National Cancer
          Institute for this outreach effort, and fostered numerous connections
          from which to explore future projects. </div>

        <div class = "description">
          In December 2016, Project DataREACH partnered with the World Health
          Organization (WHO) country office in Cameroon, to develop a data
          science platform for effectively analyzing surveillance data for
          infectious disease data in Cameroon. A two step smart surveillance
          platform was developed, the first step being the implementation of
          outbreak detection algorithms in health districts in order to enable
          alerts/flags for outbreaks in a timely manner. The second step of the
          smart surveillance platform involves a novel application of
          multivariate time series analysis to analyze the correlations between
          regions by examining cross correlations between their modeled time
          series, and using these correlations to extrapolate impact response
          conclusions, and understand disease spread and result in efficient
          resource allocation to alleviate the casualties resulting from these
          infectious diseases. </div>

          In the spring of 2017, Project DataREACH developed custom software for
          data collection, to be used in health systems without electronic data
          collection capabilities. Data stored into the server connected to this
          platform will be designed before to feed into machine learning
          pipeline, developed in partnerships with doctors and other medical
          professionals. Advancements in medical data collection can also lead
          to cardiovascular risk assessment, through ASCVD algorithm. A demo of
          an ML model deployed from this platform to predict artery narrowing
          from an assortment of risk factors can be used at db.datareach.org.
          Through this software, Project DataREACH hopes to build the first from
          scratch machine learning pipelines for medicine in Cameroon. </div>
