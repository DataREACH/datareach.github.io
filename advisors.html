          Lola Ogunyemi is a computer scientist and biomedical informatics
          researcher. Her research interests include computerized medical
          decision support, reasoning under uncertainty, 3D graphics and
          visualization, and machine learning. Her current research focuses on
          developing and evaluating novel computerized decision support systems
          for different biomedical domains, including diabetes, trauma, breast
          cancer, depression, chronic kidney disease, and HIV. She is currently
          working on a National Library of Medicine-funded R01 grant to explore
          diabetic retinopathy prediction from clinical data using different
          machine learning strategies. She has been principal investigator on a
          National Library of Medicine-funded R01 study of computerized decision
          support for penetrating trauma, and on a National Cancer
          Institute-funded R03 study of individualized breast cancer risk
          prediction using Bayesian networks. She is currently Director of
          Charles Drew University's Center for Biomedical Informatics and a
          co-leader of the UCLA CTSI's biomedical informatics program. She is
          also an Associate Adjunct Professor of Radiological Sciences in the
          David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA with the Medical Imaging
          Informatics group.
          <br> <br>
          Dr. Ogunyemi holds an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from
          Barnard College, New York, and an M.S.E, and Ph.D. in Computer and
          Information Science from the University of Pennsylvania. Before moving
          to Charles Drew University to become the Director of the Center for
          Biomedical Informatics, Dr. Ogunyemi was a biomedical informatics f
          aculty member in the Department of Radiology at Brigham and Women's
          Hospital and Harvard Medical School from 1999 until 2007. She was also
          a member of the affiliated faculty in the Harvard-MIT Division of
          Health Sciences and Technology from 2003 until 2007. She served as a
          faculty member in the Boston-area National Library of Medicine-funded
          biomedical informatics fellowship training program (1999-2007).
          <br> <br>
          She has taught graduate level biomedical informatics courses in the
          Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, at UCLA, at
          CDU, and short courses on informatics at the University of Natal,
          Durban, South Africa. She served as an editorial board member of the
          journal Computers in Biology and Medicine from 2007 until 2013. She
          served on the National Library of Medicine's Biomedical Library and
          Informatics Review Committee study section from 2003-2007 and on the
          National Library of Medicine's Literature Selection and Technical
          Review Committee from 2010-2014 as a member and as chair (2013-2014).
          She is currently an editorial board member for the Journal of
          Biomedical Informatics (2015 - 2018) and a member of the Agency for
          Healthcare Research and Quality's Health Information Technology
          Research study section (2016 - 2019).</div>

        <div class = "description">
          Jesse Engelberg is the Lead Data Scientist at Heal, a company that
          performs on-demand doctor house calls in California and beyond.  His
          work focuses on the foundations of business analytics, intelligent
          doctor assignment, and understanding supply and demand in complex
          environments.  Jesse is passionate about improving quality and access
          to healthcare in developed and developing markets.  He strongly
          believes that high quality care is a universal right and we should do
          everything we can to create and augment effective healthcare systems.
          <br> <br>
          Before Heal, Jesse worked at 23andMe as a senior data scientist, where
          he focused on solving business problems for the company's
          direct-to-consumer genetics testing products, as well as understanding
          how to improve customer engagement, a key component in the company's
          research efforts on the contributions of genetics to health and
          disease.  Previously Jesse worked on software products for pathologist
          education, and at UC Davis he led efforts on quality improvement in
          breast cancer care.  In his work as a Pathology Informatics Fellow at
          UC Davis, he used computational methods to compare breast cancer
          histopathology labs, leading to establishment of best-practices and
          collaboration across various labs within the University of California
          system.
          <br> <br>
          Jesse received his PhD in Bioengineering from the UCSF/UC Berkeley
          Joint Graduate Group in Bioengineering.  His research at UCSF involved
          creating computer simulations of biological systems, allowing
          collaborators to understand the development of simple organ
          development.  Throughout his career Jesse has worked on various
          projects and hackathons, including ones dedicated to improving patient
          care, tools for foster youth, undergraduate education, and more.
